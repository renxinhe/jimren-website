My name is Jim. I'm a third year undergrad at **UC Berkeley**.
I study electrical engineering and computer science with a focus on software engineering.<br/><br/>
I have 6 years of Java, and 3 years of Python and C experience. As a full stack developer, I'm particularly interested in machine learning, data science, and embedded systems.
